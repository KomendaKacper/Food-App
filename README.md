# Food Ordering App

This **Food Ordering App** is a frontend project focused on honing my React, HTML, and CSS skills. It's designed to provide a user-friendly experience for browsing, selecting, and ordering food items. The backend is planned for future development, where it will handle data persistence, authentication, and more advanced features.

## ðŸŽ¨ Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React (with functional components, hooks, and context for state management), HTML, CSS
- **Styling**: Responsive and user-friendly CSS for a seamless experience across devices

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

This project is a learning exercise aimed at:

- Improving my skills in React, particularly with state management and component-based architecture.
- Practicing responsive design techniques using CSS.
- Gaining experience in building a frontend that can easily integrate with a backend API in the future.

## ðŸš§ Future Development

The backend will be developed to add more functionality, including:

- **Authentication**: User registration and login functionality.
- **Order History**: Users will be able to view their past orders.
- **API Integration**: Fetching data from a backend API to populate food items, handle orders, and process payments.
